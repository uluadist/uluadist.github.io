configure: error: Package requirements (sofia-sip-ua >= 1.12.11) were not met:

No package 'sofia-sip-ua' found

installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables SOFIA_SIP_UA_CFLAGS
and SOFIA_SIP_UA_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.
